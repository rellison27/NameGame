# The Namegame

Learning your coworkers names while starting a new job can be very useful. Your test project is to make it happen! We have a simple version hosted at [https://wta-namegame.herokuapp.com/](https://wta-namegame.herokuapp.com/) which you can test. The API is located at [https://willowtreeapps.com/api/v1.0/profiles/](https://willowtreeapps.com/api/v1.0/profiles/).

## Run

Open index.html in Google Chrome.

## I Selected Option 1

Present the user with five faces and ask them to identify the listed name. This is essentially what is working already. To spruce things up, implement a few features of your choice.

1. Team mode. The API returns people who used to work here too. Current team members have titles and former team members don't.
2. Reverse mode. Show five names with one picture.
3. M Mode. I wanted more people involved in this mode.
4. Hint mode/my own idea. This is actually as you click and get it wrong the person goes away.
